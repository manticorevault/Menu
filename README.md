# Menu
It's a menu with some programs and games I've made. It's an exercise from https://pythonschool.net/basics/menu-program/
to practice function definition and function call. In this menu program I put a hangman game, a guessing number game
a small text-based adventure game and a name generator program. It also has an Exit feature.
